# STM32-RFID
This small repository contains two projects for STM32 development board NUCLEO-G474RE.
The main goal was to verify how to use 7941W module to read and write RFID Tags.  
 
# 7941W - a dual-band RFID reader and writer module
7941W module this is a dual frequency 13.56 MHz and 125 KHz RFID Reader Writer Wireless Module. 
UART  for IC/ID Card

# Necessary hardware and connections
The nesessary hardware and connections for these projects have been minimized to make easy start with  

# RFID_7941W_Replicator
Teh first project is created as an example of 

# RFID_7941W_Console
Second project is a bit more complicated but
